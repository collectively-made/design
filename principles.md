# Principles
### Creating meaniful work through values

---

### Collaboration over cooperation
When collaborating, people work together (co-labor) on a single shared goal. When cooperating, people perform together (co-operate) while working on selfish yet common goals. Solitary work is necessary, but collaboration spurs innovation and diversity of thought as well as ideas.

### People-first engineering
Compassion, empathy, and inclusion are key-factors to creating work that seeks to advance humanity. We create _for_ people. We are _not_ the end-user. 

### Holistic design
Effective, successful design requires holistic approaches â€” a thorough understanding of the problem space, the people involved, the possible solutions, and well-defined implementation.
